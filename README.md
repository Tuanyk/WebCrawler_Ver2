First, get the right category link from xinyushuwu website:
for example: http://www.xinyushuwu.com/xianxia/1.html

then, you will paste the part "http://www.xinyushuwu.com/xianxia/" to the get_all_novels_link.py, in the bottom: 

save_all_novels_in_category("http://www.xinyushuwu.com/xianxia/")

then, run this file to get all the novels' link.

After all the links are crawled. Run the get_contents.py.

You can use nohup to run it from a VPS.
